            <h2>Salvation</h2>
            <p>The Bible warns us in Proverbs 14:12, "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." So, as a wise man once asked, "What must I do to be saved?"</p>

            <p>God has given the church a great commission to proclaim the Gospel to all nations. However, not all believers are called to a foreign field. Serving the Lord in a foreign land often brings unimaginable spiritual and physical challenges. According to scripture, those at home who pray and give to the work abroad are blessed to share a part in that work.</p>

            <h3>God's Gift of Salvation</h3>
            <p>Salvation is man's greatest need because our sin is a severe offense against God and it condemns us to an eternity of unbearable punishment. (Revelation 21:8) "ALL have sinned and come short of the Glory of God." – Romans 3:23</p>
            <p>The Bible says we cannot save ourselves from that awful destiny by our feeble standards of virtue: "All our righteousness are filthy rags" – Isaiah 64:6 and "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us" – Titus 3:5</p>

            <p>But the good news is that God loved us so much that He sent His Son Jesus Christ to pay the penalty for our sin. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” – John 3:16 and "God commendeth His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" – Romans 5:8</p>

            <p>Then Jesus rose to life on the third day, defeating death itself and securing everlasting life. (John 11:25)</p>

            <h3>The Only Way to Salvation</h3>
            <p>The Bible makes it clear that Jesus is the ONLY way to salvation: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” – Acts 4:12 and “Jesus saith unto him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.'” – John 14:6</p>

            <p>Our eternal destiny depends on our personal decision, whether to trust in the only One who can cover our sin debt. According to the Bible, if we realize we are sinners and trust Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, we will be saved. ... “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” – Romans 10:9 and “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” – Romans 10:13</p>

            <h3>What Will You Do with God's Gift?</h3>
            <p>Dear Friend, our sincere desire is for you to come to a personal, saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and know your eternity is secure. It is the most important decision you will ever make. Please contact us if you have any questions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Salvation by grace through faith alone without works with a repentant heart and confession to God for our sins/sinful nature (Eph. 2:8,9; Rom. 10:9,13; I John 1:9)</li>
                <li>Baptism by immersion after an individual has been born again (I Cor. 15:1-4)</li>
                <li>Eternal Security of the Believer (I John 5:13; John 6:37; 10:27-29)</li>

                <li>The Church is the saved body of Jewish and Gentile believers (I Cor. 12:13,27; Eph. 2:10-22)</li>
                <li>Man’s depravity comes as a result of Adam’s fall (I Cor. 15:22; Rom. 5:12)</li>
                <li>Jesus Christ is the only hope for mankind (Rom. 10:13; Acts 2:21; Rev. 22:17)</li>
                <li>Grace is available to all mankind, tragically refused by some (II Pe. 3:9; Rom. 2:4)</li>
